# Data Analysis with pandas
This project is designed to analyze student performance data across multiple semesters and subjects. The data is stored in a CSV file and processed using the `pandas` library in Python. The analysis includes identifying students with scores below 50, calculating average scores for each subject in each semester, finding the students with the highest average scores, determining the hardest subject, and creating a new dataframe with average scores per semester.
